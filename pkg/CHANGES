Version 0.4

o Function 'read.multiplex()' was thoroughly updated. In addition to CTS 
  and MFI tables it can now read results table. For xPONENT files it now 
  reads also the nominal concentrations of standards and QCs straight from 
  the file, so the 'immunoassay.kits' data.frame is no longer required for 
  this type of data (it's still required for "IS" data). In addition, it 
  reads the fit information (coefficients, r-squared, etc).
  
o The 'check()' function is now extended to work for 'ima' objects.
  
o Methods for 'ima' class updated. New 'summary()' method added that displays
  fit summary for the loaded run data - utilizing the updated 'check()' function.
  'plot()' and 'print()' methods also updated to work with the new structure
  of the 'ima' class objects.
